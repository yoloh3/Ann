# Introduction

The SISLAB team in LSI Design Contest 2018.

Design challenge: "Neural Network (Backpropagation)"

The goals of project is learning about neural network, the flow from algorithm to
hardware architecture, having an result.


# Team members

* [Huy-Hung Ho](https://yoloh3.github.io)
* Van-Thuat Nguyen
* Xuan-Thuan Nguyen
* Van-Dung Nguyen


# Architecture

## Phases

1. Study about Supervised learning of Neural Network (using Backpropagation)
  algorithm (find out at less a optimization).
2. Software simulation by C/C++ (or an other) language.
3. Hardware simulation by VHDL language.
4. Synthesis in FPGA. (if enough time)


## Plan

*8th Oct - 7th Nov: (31 days)*

- Studying algorithm
	+ Collecting the state-of-the-art papers (keyword: hardware backpropagation neural network)
	+ Try to find the optimization
- Sofware simulation (matlab, C/C++, speeding Matlab code)

*8th Nov - 10th Dec: (34 days)*

- Trainning VHDL tools (ubuntu, vsim, git)
- Studying FPGA synthesis and Synopsys tools (Synphony Modelâ„¢ Compiler, Synplify Pro, Design Compiler)
- Architecture demo of ANN, writing VHDL code a part
- Writing VHDL for full ANN

*11th Doc - 7th Jan: (28 days)*

- Writing VHDL

*8th Jan - 30th Jan: (23 days)*

- Verification, testing in FPGA


## Timeline

- Start time	: 8th Oct, 2017
- Deadline		: 31st Jan, 2018
- Timing		: 116 days
- Do the exam	: 11th Dec - 7th Jan
