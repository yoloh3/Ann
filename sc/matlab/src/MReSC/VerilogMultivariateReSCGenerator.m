  %Reconfigurable Architecture Based on Stochastic Logic, or ReSC, is a method
  %developed by Weikang Qian, Xin Li, Marc D. Riedel, Kia Bazargan, and David J.
  %Lilja for approximating the computation of any function with domain and range
  %in the unit interval as a stochastic circuit using a Bernstein polynomial
  %approximation of the function. The Multivariate form allows extension to
  %functions of several variables by using the product of the individual
  %polynomials on those variables. This function generates a complete
  %multivariate ReSC module written in Verilog, containing the following files:
  % MReSC_[nameSuffix].v - The core stochastic module
  % MReSC_wrapper_[nameSuffix].v - A wrapper for the module that converts inputs
  %                                inputs and outputs between binary and
  %                                stochastic representations.
  % MReSC_test_[nameSuffix].v - A testbench for the system.
  % LFSR_[log(N)]_bit_added_zero_[nameSuffix].v - The RNG for generating
  %                                               stochastic numbers.
  
  %Parameters:
  % coeff     : a list of coefficients of the Bernstein polynomial, ordered
  %             w_0_0..._0, w_0_0..._1, ..., w_0_0..._1_0, etc.; each
  %             coefficient should fall within the unit interval
  % degrees   : the degrees of the component Bernstein polynomials in order
  % N         : the length of the stochastic bitstreams, must be a power of 2
  % m_input   : the length in bits of the input, at most log2(N)
  % m_coeff   : the length in bits of the coefficients, at most log2(N)
  % nameSuffix: a distinguishing suffix to append to the name of each Verilog
  %             module
  
  %Optional Parameters:
  % singleWeightLFSR: Use the same LFSR for every constant. (Default true)
