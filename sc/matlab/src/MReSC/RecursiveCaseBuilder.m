function RecursiveCaseBuilder (fp, degrees, bits, w, x, i, tabs)
  %Recursively builds the case statement for a multivariate lFSR's multiplexer
  
  %Parameters:
  % fp     : verilog file to write code to
  % degrees: the degrees of the Bernstein polynomials
  % bits: 
  % w      : index of the weight to use in the 1D weight vector
  % x      : index of the x input being considered at this depth
  % i      : index of the Bernstein polynomial at this particular depth
  % tabs   : string containing tabs to put at the beginning of lines to keep
  %          indentation clean
  
  if (x > length(degrees))
    fprintf(fp, '%s%d\''d%d: z = w[%d];\n', tabs, bits(x - 1), i, w);
  else
    if (x == 1)
      fprintf(fp, '%scase(sum_%d)\n', tabs, x);
    else
      fprintf(fp, '%s%d''d%d: case(sum_%d)\n', tabs, bits(x - 1), i, x);
    end
    for j=0:degrees(x)
      newTabs = sprintf('%s\t', tabs);
      RecursiveCaseBuilder(fp, degrees, bits,...
                           w + prod(degrees(x+1:length(degrees)) + 1) * j,...
                           x + 1, j, newTabs);
