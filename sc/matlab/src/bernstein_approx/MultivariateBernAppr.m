function [coefs, obj, H, b, c] = MultivariateBernAppr(vals, degrees)
  %This function finds the closet bivariate Bernstein polynomial approximation 
  %to the given function funchandle f(x,y). The bivariate Bernstein polynomial 
  %has the x degree as n and y degree as m.
  % 
  %It optimizes the objective function obj = coefs'*H*coefs + 2*b'*obj + c where
  %coefs is a flattened vector representation of the coefficient matrix. For
  %example, in two dimensions, [b_{00}, b_{01},..., b_{0m}, b_{10},..., b_{nm}]
  %is the vector representation of the coefficient matrix
  %
  %     b_{00}, b_{01}, ..., b_{0m}
  %     b_{10}, b_{11}, ..., b_{1m}
  %                 ...
  %     b_{n0}, b_{n1}, ..., b_{nm}
  %
  %The constraint is
  %0 <= coefs <=1. Note b_{ij} (0 <= i <= n, 0 <= j <= m) is the coefficient of
  %the term B_{i,n}(x)*B_{j,m}(y) in the bivariate Bernsteain polynomial.

  %         being approximated
  % degrees: the degrees of the Bernstein polynomial to generate
