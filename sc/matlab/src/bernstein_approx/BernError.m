  %Calculate the error of a Bernstein approximation on a set of sample data

  %        being approximated
  % coeff: the coeffecients of the Bernstein polynomial
  
  %Optional Parameters:
  % errorMetric: metric by which to compare approximate and expected results,
  %              default MeanSquareError
