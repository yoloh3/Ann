function [coefs, obj, H, b, c] = BernAppr(vals, degree)
  %This function finds the closet Bernstein polynomial approximation of degree n
  %to the given vectors representing a function.
  %
  %It optimizes the objective function obj = coefs'*H*coefs + 2*b'*coefs + c
  %subject to 0 <= coefs <=1, where coefs is the vector of Bernstein
  %coefficients to be solved.
  %Matrix H and vector b correspond to the matrix H and vector c defined in the
  %Section 2.2 of the paper "An Architecture for Fault-Tolerant Computation with
  %Stochastic Logic". Constant c is the integral of func_to_appr*func_to_appr
  %over the given range [int_l, int_u].
  
  %Parameters:
  % vals  : two-column vector representing inputs and outputs of the function
  %         being approximated
  % degree: the degree of the Bernstein polynomial to generate
