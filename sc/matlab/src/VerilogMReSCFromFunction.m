  %Reconfigurable Architecture Based on Stochastic Logic, or ReSC, is a method
  %developed by Weikang Qian, Xin Li, Marc D. Riedel, Kia Bazargan, and David J.
  %Lilja for approximating the computation of any function with domain and range
  %in the unit interval as a stochastic circuit using a Bernstein polynomial
  %approximation of the function. The Multivariate form allows extension to
  %functions of several variables by using the product of the individual
  %polynomials on those variables. This function, given a function handle,
  %generates a complete multivariate ReSC module written in Verilog, containing
  %the following files:
  % ReSC_[nameSuffix].v - The core stochastic module
  % ReSC_wrapper_[nameSuffix].v - A wrapper for the module that converts inputs
  %                               inputs and outputs between binary and
  %                               stochastic representations.
  % ReSC_test_[nameSuffix].v - A testbench for the system.
  % LFSR_[log(N)]_bit_added_zero_[nameSuffix].v - The RNG for generating
  %                                               stochastic numbers.
  
  %Parameters:
  % func      : a function handle for the function being modeled
  % degrees   : the desired degrees of the Bernstein polynomials underlying the
  %             ReSC (one per input, higher means a larger circuit but less
  %             error)
  % N         : the length of the stochastic bitstreams, must be a power of 2
  % m_input   : the length in bits of the input, at most log2(N)
  % m_coeff   : the length in bits of the coefficients, at most log2(N)
  % nameSuffix: a distinguishing suffix to append to the name of each Verilog
  %             module
  
  %Optional Parameters:
  % singleWeightLFSR: Use the same LFSR for every constant. (Default true)
  % domains         : The domains of each input of the function being modeled
  %                   each row representing one variable. If there is only one
  %                   row, it will be used for every variable (Default [0, 1])
  % granularities   : The number of data points to sample on each axis in
  %                   approximating the function. If only one value is given, it
  %                   will be used for every axis. (Default 100)
